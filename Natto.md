# Natto Fermentation Check List  

**Written by:** ckswoopy

## **Procedure:**

#### Soaking
* Soak beans for `24+ hours` 
    * add < 1/4 teaspoon (15g) baking soda (optional)
    * pre-boil beans for 1 minute before 24-hr soaking (optional)
    	* alternatively soak 12 hours (or until germination-- looks cloudy), then pre-boil and then re-soak 12 hours
    
#### Cooking
* Boil or Steam until soybeans are <u>**extremely**</u> `soft`
    * Boiling may take 3 hours on low heat
    * Steaming may take 6 hours on low heat
* Sterilize utensils in the boiling pot for about one minute before turning off heat

#### Prepare Cooked Beans
* While beans are **still boiling hot**:
    * immediately stir evenly `1/2 spoon of molasses` (provides nutrients)
	* split the beans into `four` parts:
		* One (1) yogurt-maker container
		* Two (2) glass containers
		* At least 3 Spoonfuls of beans to be mashed
	* keep soybeans no more than `3 bean layers` high
	    * ideally 1-2 layers (for oxygen flow)
	    * ideally straw-type or cloth corrugated container surface for airflow

#### Inoculate Cooked Beans with Bacteria
* Add `live natto starter` to still very warm boiled beans [70C is OK]
    * Good idea to always save 10-20% of previous natto batch as live starter
    * While waiting for the next steps, keep containers covered
* Save boiled water to make starter solution-- 
	* immediately dissolve:
	    * `1/2 spoon` brown sugar (helps to kick start fermentation)
	    * `1/4 spoon` of salt (helps with stringiness)
	* wait until boiled water is cooler (under `50C`) then add the `starter powder`
	* stir `mashed soybeans` into starter solution
* Add `starter solution mash` into all three containers

#### Fermenting Natto
* Wrap glass containers to provide a seal
    * `double wrap` is preferred, but single wrap is OK
    * `poke` many holes into all layers of plastic wrap 
* Ensure **perfect** environment for fermentation (check list):
    * **Temperature** (40-45C), `ideally 40C` for best stringiness
    * **Air flow** (free "gentle" airflow through "proofer"): **`Oxygen required`**
    * **Moisture** (from cooked beans, but can add small amount of saved water)
* Save any extra boiled water to add moisture during fermentation
    * Check on fermentation (after `12-16 hours`), add saved water as necessary
    * If too much water still submerges bottom layer beans, pour excess water
    * If we don't use extra water during fermentation, can add during aging process
* Ferment for 20-24 hours to complete a normal cycle
    * For more pungent and stronger flavor, ferment up to 36 hours
    * Alternatively, after 24 hours, let sit with yogurt maker turned off

#### Storage and Aging
* Aging
    * Cover or seal containers during aging (to prevent contamination)
    * Let the fermentation rest at room temperature for 6-24 hours
    * Then put into refrigerator (0-5C) to stop fermentation and slowly age
* Storage Container
    * Preferably non-reactive glass containers
    * Should be tightly sealed (to prevent contamination)
    * Can be stored in refrigerator for 3 weeks
    * Can be stored in freezer for 6 months

## Natto Q&A

**Is it normal for my NATTO to be so stringy?**

> Yes, the sticky string (a form of glutamic acid) includes the active ingredient, nattokinase. It is part of what makes natto unique.

**There is a distinct odor, is that normal?**

> If it is a strong smell, similar to ammonia, it means that the natto has over-fermented.

**What are the white spots on the beans?**

> As NATTO continues to ferment, the proteins start to break down into amino acid crystals. They are safe to eat.

**Is it possible to cook hot dishes with NATTO?**

> When the enzyme Nattokinase is heated to a temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer for more than 10 minutes, the enzyme loses its effectiveness. However, you may add NATTO to your favorite pasta dish, to an omelet or hot dish of choice at the end of preparation and NATTO will keep its nutritional integrity. See our Recipe section for ideas and preparation tips.

**Can beans other than soybeans be fermented in this way?**

> Yes, other beans can be fermented in the same way. However, the taste and smell of other fermented beans will differ, because of the inherent difference in the levels of protein and sugar. Indeed, soybeans were probably chosen out of the myriad beans available in Japan because of the ability for natto to maximize the beanâ€™s nutritional benefits.

**How long does the typical natto fermentation process take?**

> It takes approximately 20 hours of constant temperature management for natto to ferment.

**What's the nutritional value of natto?**

> Natto is a natural energy food that is:
>   * High in Protein
>   * Good Source of Dietary Fiber
>   * Rich in Vitamin K2 & B2
>   * Contains Calcium & Iron
>   * Gluten Free
>   * Contains No Preservatives

**How much water should the soybeans soak up?**

> With enough water absorbed, soybeans become 2-2.3 times heavier than before water-absorption. By making soybeans absorb enough water, it will make soybeans easy to be heated in the next steaming and boiling process, and thus ensuring soybeans to be boiled with even flavor and softness. 

**What type of soybean should I use?**

> Soybeans for natto vary in size from super large to tiny ones; in many cases, small and tiny ones are used. People prefer natto made of small or tiny beans presumably because when rice grains and natto beans are not much different in size, natto is easy to be mingled with rice and pleasant to the taste. Moreover, the smaller soybeans are, the larger their surface area becomes, which in turn means more sticky paste and delicious flavor natto produces, and therefore, likely to taste better.

**Should I boil or steam the soybeans?**

> If possible, steaming in a pressure cooker is the preferred choice. Steaming kills various bacteria attached to the surface of soybeans. Moreover, soybeans become soft and full, which is the condition easy for natto yeasts to take nutrition and grow. Furthermore, steaming makes soybeans easy for various enzymes produced by natto yeasts to penetrate and dissolve the ingredients. Compared to boiling, steaming allows the soybeans to retain more of its nutrients and the structural integrity of the bean itself.

**After cooking, when should I inoculate the beans with natto bacteria?**

>  In order to prevent the contamination of bacteria, it is ideal to inoculate the beans with bacteria when the temperature of boiled beans is about 70-90 degrees Celsius. Natto bacteria spores can survive boiling temperatures whereas most other bacteria do not have a biological mechanism to survive high heat.

**What steps are necessary to prepare the fermentation container?**

> The container should be as sterile as possible. There are a variety of fermentation containers used by natto manufacturers, including Styrofoam boxes, paper cups, plastic bags and of paper-thin sheets of wood. Boiled beans should be packed in the container while they are still hot in order to avoid the contamination of bacteria. Natto bacteria need oxygen to grow. Therefore, for the good passage of air to facilitate natto yeasts to grow, soybeans should not be packed too tightly so that they can have appropriate space among them. The more corrugated or rougher the container surface, the better air will flow between the beans.

**What is the ideal temperature for fermentation?**

> The ideal fermentation temperature is 38-42 degrees Celsius for fully 16-24 hours.

**What is the aging process after fermentation?**

> After 16-24 hours of fermentation, the natto should be taken out of the heating "proofer" and allowed to cool to room temperature naturally to stop the fermentation as well as for de-humidification. This resting also has the effect of removing the metabolic gas. The natto is then refrigerated (from 0-5 degrees Celsius) which puts the natto bacteria into a dormant resting state. This is called maturation, an aging process. This temperature control from fermentation to maturation will produce specific characteristic traits of taste, texture and stringiness in natto.

**What do I do if my natto is not sticky and does not much taste like natto?**

> Experiment with amount and type of sugar in the natto bacterial starter solution. Sugar, a simple carbohydrate, is "baby food" for bacillus natto waking up from sleep. The more sugar you add, the better the natto fermentation, but the sweeter it becomes if it is too much. You might want to experiment with other types of sugar such as brown sugar and molasses. Salt seems to affect fermentation as well. Also experiment with amount of water in the solution. Too little water hinders the fermentation, but too much of it makes your natto soggy. Instead of boiled water you may want to use the strained water at the end of steaming beans. You might want to try a longer fermentation time or leaving freshly fermented natto in the "proofer" (without the heat on) for up to another day. Aging also helps.

**Can I just take natto bacillus instead of natto for health benefits?**

> Yes and no. Some research indicates natto bacillus becomes active in our digestive system and produces vitamin K2 and possibly some other nutrients and enzymes, too. However it might depend upon what kind of food you eat and what kind of intestinal flora you have. Natto on the other hand is full of these nutrients propagated from bacillus natto.

**What if my fermentation environment doesn't have perfectly controlled temperature?**

> According to Dr. Toshio Hara (Prof. of Kyushu university), natto bacillus live between 10C (50F) to 65C (149F) degrees, and most suitable temperature is 40C (104F) to 45C (113F) degrees. The natto will turn to seed spores under 10C degrees or over 65C degrees. Humidity is also necessary at the right temperature. Humidity naturally comes out from the soybeans and water used for mixing bacillus powder, but you can add a bit more water to the soybeans or add a cup of water near your container so it evaporates into the air flow around the soybeans.

**If my fermentation box is enclosed without oxygen, will this cause problems in the natto fermentation?**

> If there is not enough oxygen, then the fermentation does not proceed well. There also needs to be adequate volume of air and airflow. It seems 10 litter of air in an entirely enclosed container is a good standard for 500g (17.5oz) dry soybean weight before water soaking. With a semi-open container, just make sure there is airflow.

**Is a sour flavor in natto normal?**

> Usually sour flavors (acidic) means the natto bacteria has lost its competitive battle during the fermentation with other bacteria. This means your natto is  contaminated with a large amount of other bacteria (whether good or bad to one's health is unknown during wild fermentation).

**Is it normal for beans to have a white film on its surface after fermentation?**

> Yes, this is fine. Probably the white coloring looks like it is frosted. It is the sign of successful fermentation.

**There is an ammonia flavor in the natto that does not dissipate. Is that normal?**

> During fermentation, there is often an aroma that might smell slight like ammonia. But if the flavor stays in the natto itself after cooling and aging, then it probably means the fermentation time was too long. However, some people like this more pungent flavor in their natto.

## Natto Recipes

**Natto and Rice:** White steamed or fried rice (even mixed grains: brown, red and black rices, millet, barley). For fried rice, any leftovers can add to the mix such as roasted pork, veggies, eggs, sausages ... all topped with raw natto. Sushi-type rice (with sweet/sour taste and lots of resistant starches) is even better. Can be topped with dried bonito flakes or sesame seeds. Wasabi, cheese, mayonnaise, nori (seaweed), perilla leaves or umeboshi (pickled plums) are good additions. Pepper chilies or tuna go great with natto on rice.

**Natto on Noodles:** Natto mixed with white noodles of any kind (even ramen), whether with soup or just drained on a plate is wonderfully basic. Can add small portions of meat and vegetables or seaweed. If soup, a bit of miso and tofu is a perfect compliment.

**Natto Spaghetti:** Fry some garlic and onion in a pan with olive oil. Cook spaghetti accordingly for best texture and taste. Add the spaghetti noodles to the pan and cook. Mix well with the onions and serve with a portion of natto on top. Can also add tomato or Bolognese sauces.

**Kimchi Natto:** Mixing kimchi with a serving of natto and serve on a bed of freshly steamed Japanese rice, with a soft boiled egg on the side. This is a deliciously strong and intensely flavored way to enjoy natto.

**Natto and Eggs:** Add natto on top of egg (prepared in any way: fried, sunny-side up, poached, scrambled, hard boiled, pickled, raw).

**Natto Omelet:** Add a portion of natto to hot oil in a pan, and brown it quickly before the inclusion of soy sauce and a beaten egg. Can add optional vegetables, mushrooms or salty meats as omelet stuffing. Let cool a bit, then add a portion of raw natto on top of the omelet. Can also top it all with some cheese (such as parmesan). Also can top with natural honey or a bit of ketchup for those who like a little bit of sweetness.

**Ground pork with natto:** Add just a touch of sesame and vegetable oils to a saucepan and quickly fry grated ginger. Next comes ground pork, browned until almost cooked through. Turn off the stove. Add chopped green onion, sake, soy sauce, tofu (optional) and natto to the pork and let simmer together gently in the residual heat.

**Stuffed Peppers and Tofu Pouches:** Ground pork stuffed in peppers or tofu, with natto as topping.

**Natto Pizza or Flatbread:** Added to pizzas and flat breads.
