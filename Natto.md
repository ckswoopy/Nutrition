# Natto Fermentation Check List  

**Written by:** ckswoopy

## **Procedure:**

#### Soaking
* Soak beans for `24+ hours` 
    * add < 1/4 teaspoon (15g) baking soda (optional)
    * pre-boil beans for 1 minute before 24-hr soaking (optional)
    
#### Cooking
* Boil or Steam until soybeans are <u>**extremely**</u> `soft`
    * Boiling may take 3 hours on low heat
    * Steaming may take 6 hours on low heat
* Sterilize utensils in the boiling pot for 5 minutes before turning off heat

#### Prepare Cooked Beans
* While beans are **still hot**:
    * immediately stir evenly `1/2 spoon of molasses` (provides nutrients)
	* split the beans into `four` parts:
		* One (1) yogurt-maker container
		* Two (2) glass containers
		* At least 3 Spoonfuls of beans to be mashed
	* keep soybeans no more than `3 bean layers` high
	    * ideally 1-2 layers (for oxygen flow)
	    * ideally straw-type or cloth corrugated container surface for airflow

#### Inoculate Cooked Beans with Bacteria
* Add `live natto starter` to still hot boiled beans
    * Good idea to save 10-20% of previous fermented batch as live starter
    * While waiting for the next steps, keep containers covered
* Save boiled water to make starter solution-- 
	* immediately dissolve:
	    * `1/2 spoon` brown sugar (helps to kick start fermentation)
	    * `1/4 spoon` of salt (helps with stringiness)
	* wait until boiled water is cooler (under `50C`) then add the `starter powder`
	* stir `mashed soybeans` into starter solution
* Add `starter solution mash` into all three containers

#### Fermenting Natto
* Wrap glass containers to provide a seal
    * `double wrap` is preferred, but single wrap is OK
    * `poke` many holes into all layers of plastic wrap 
* Ensure **perfect** environment for fermentation (check list):
    * **Temperature** (40-45C), `ideally 40C` for best stringiness
    * **Air flow** (free "gentle" airflow through "proofer"): **`Oxygen required`**
    * **Moisture** (from cooked beans, but can add small amount of saved water)
* Save any extra boiled water to add moisture during fermentation
    * Check on fermentation (after `12-16 hours`), add saved water as necessary
    * If too much water still submerges bottom layer beans, pour excess water
    * If we don't use the solution during fermentation, can add it after done
* Ferment for 20-24 hours to complete a normal cycle
    * For more pungent and stronger flavor, ferment up to 36 hours
    * Alternatively, after 24 hours, let sit with yogurt maker turned off

#### Storage and Aging
* Aging
    * Cover or seal containers during aging (to prevent contamination)
    * Let the fermentation rest at room temperature for 6-24 hours
    * Then put into refrigerator (0-5C) to stop fermentation and slowly age
* Storage Container
    * Preferably non-reactive glass containers
    * Should be tightly sealed (to prevent contamination)
    * Can be stored in refrigerator for 3 weeks
    * Can be stored in freezer for 6 months

**Homemade Natto Costs (2 week supply):**
* `Boiling soybeans` for 3 hours, takes about 1 gas unit = $4 HKD
* `Soybeans` 300g dry weight; 600g after soaking; 750g after fermentation = $1 HKD
* Fermentation yogurt maker `heating` for 24 hours (15w) @ $1.154 HKD/kWH = $0.41 HKD
* Starter < $0.10 HKD (Sourced from China)
* Baking Soda < $0.10 HKD
* **Total cost = $6 HKD**

**Cost Comparison Comparison to Store Bought Natto (2 week supply):** 
* Natto Store Bought $17 HKD for 40g x 3 pack = 120g ~ 1/6th quantity
* **Total cost = $102 HKD**

**Savings:** > <u>95%</u> (more if making a larger batch)

**Yearly Savings:** > $2,500 HKD

### Experimental additional ingredients to supply biotin:
* Red beet
* Sweet potato
* Oatmeal
* Banana
* Rice
* Egg
* Miso
